# week-4-game

This game has 4 crystals that have randomly assigned values. You also have a randomly generated number that you need to combine the value of the crystals to hit. The game will log each crystal click and add it to your score. If your score equals the value of the randmo number exactly then you win, if not then you lose. The game will log wins and losses. The game is made with js, jquery, bootstrap, and some custom css.
